This repository stores the code for the website I am developing for the breast
cancer GWAS project with Michael Newton, Fred Boehm, and others.

Steps:

- Prepare the database:
  - Make a sqlite database from the files provided by Fred, via
    make_database.R.
  - Verify that the database was built correctly, via python3
    verify_database.py.
